I'm currently pivoting my career to work on AI safety. Previously I was a research engineer at <a href="https://granica.ai/">Granica</a>, working on data compression. I graduated from Caltech in 2019, with B.S. degrees in mathematics (advisor Nets Katz), computer science (advisor Chris Umans), and philosophy (advisor Chip Sebens).
